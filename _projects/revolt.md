**Revolt** is a chat platform built with modern web technologies. The backend is built in Rust using Rocket, the frontend using Preact with styled-components.  
  
I have been handling second-level project coordination starting in August 2021.  
Starting January of 2022, I have been handling the project's public relations, among other things as the primary manager of the social media accounts.  
  
In addition, I have specified the project's brand design guidelines to give the project a uniform look across all media and established social media cards as a quickly recognizable and information-packed way to announce features in small, easy bites.
