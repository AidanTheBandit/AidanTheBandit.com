**aidanthebandit.com** is the website you are on right now, or at least I hope so. It's written in TypeScript, React, and Next.js, and it's entirely static. The styling is powered by Styled Components, and the content is powered by Markdown using Rehype. It was designed by !(infi)[https://infi.sh]. This is my for of the site with some changes to the colors and branding.
