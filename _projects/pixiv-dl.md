**pixiv-dl** is a command line tool for downloading images from [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/). It's multithreaded and supports downloading multiple images at once. It's written in Rust and uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) for its async I/O.

Inspired by Jan's bash [pixiv-dl](https://github.com/janderedev/pixiv-dl), it's a simple and fast way to download images from Pixiv.
