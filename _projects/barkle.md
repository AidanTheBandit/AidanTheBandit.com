Barkle is a site that aims to combine many belovid features from sites like Twitter and Discord. Barkle is a fork of Misskey but has had many changes since it's initial release. Barkle has been modified to be much more scalible and also have features like verified. Unlike Misskey though Barkle does not support fedi (fediverse). Barkle is built to be a more standalone social media site and will be taking a different path of development than Misskey.
