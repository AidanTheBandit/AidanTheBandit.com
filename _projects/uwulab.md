**uwulab** is a versatile Reddit clone written in Rust using [Actix](https://actix.rs) and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). It is a single-page application that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The frontend is written in React using the [MUI](https://mui.com) framework.  
  
Try not to ask me about the name too much.
