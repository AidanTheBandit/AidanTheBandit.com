**infi.sh** is the website you are on right now, or at least I hope so. It's written in TypeScript, React, and Next.js, and it's entirely static. The styling is powered by Styled Components, and the content is powered by Markdown using Rehype. It was designed entirely by me in about an hour, and I'm not sure if I'll ever truly finish it.
